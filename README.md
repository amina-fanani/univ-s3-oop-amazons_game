## Project description
This project is about implementing the game Amazons.
It's a two player strategy game played on a checkerboard or chessboard.
The goal is to capture your opponent's pieces.
A move consists of two steps: moving a piece and shooting an arrow at a square.
The square is then inaccessible to other players' pieces for the rest of the game.
The winner is the last player to complete a move.
